VERSIONING AND PROVENANCE

1. Last modification date
2025-10-06


2. Was data derived from another source?
No


--------------------------
METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------


1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
A single thermometer was used to measure the temperature of each of the liquids until the temperature stopped changing. The initial and final temperatures were recorded, in addition to the time it took for the temperature to reach equilibrium.


2. Methods for processing the data: 
The processing was minimal with the initial and final temperatures being recorded and the total time being calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time.


3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data:
The only software required to interpret the dataset is Google Sheets. Alternatively, the data can be downloaded as a CSV and interpreted in any other way necessary.
